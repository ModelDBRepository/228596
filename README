The simulation program produces the computational figures of the article:

Mechanisms underlying a thalamocortical transformation during active tactile
sensation
Diego Adrian Gutnisky, Jianing Yu, Samuel Andrew Hires1, Minh-Son To,
Michael Bale, Karel Svoboda, David Golomb.

The directories are:

simulation_program: files of the simulation program in C.
To compile the program, write:
make tc

scripts: auxiliary scripts that are used to process data from the simulations
and generate figures using XMGRace.

generate_figures: generate panels from figures in the paper. 

parameter_survey: generate panels from figures in the paper with parameter
surveys.

The reference parameter file, in both generate_figures and parameter_survey,
is tc.n.a1.

Each command procedure in generate_figures is named figureXX.com.
It modifies the parameter file, runs simulations and ises scripts to process
the data and generates the figures. See README in that directory.

In parameter_survey, python scripts are used to generate parameter files.
After the program is run for those files, the python scripts mav.py and pavh.py
generate panels. See README in that directory.
